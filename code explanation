  ðŸ”¹ Handles missing values, categorical data encoding, and feature scaling.  
  ðŸ”¹ Uses Pandas and Scikit-Learn for data transformation.  
  ðŸ”¹ Ensures data is clean and suitable for machine learning models.  

- Feature Selection  
  ðŸ”¹ Identifies key attributes that influence credit approval decisions.  
  ðŸ”¹ Uses **RandomForest feature importance** to select the most relevant features.  
  ðŸ”¹ Helps improve model accuracy by reducing unnecessary variables.  

- Multi-Model Comparison  
  ðŸ”¹ Compares different machine learning models like **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost**.  
  ðŸ”¹ Evaluates models based on **accuracy, performance, and efficiency**.  
  ðŸ”¹ Helps in selecting the best algorithm for credit approval prediction.  

- Interactive Predictions  
  ðŸ”¹ Allows users to input applicant details such as **income, credit history, and employment status**.  
  ðŸ”¹ Processes inputs, transforms data, and applies the trained model for prediction.  
  ðŸ”¹ Provides an instant approval or rejection result for user queries.  

- Fairness Analysis
  ðŸ”¹ Analyzes model predictions for potential **bias in demographic groups**.  
  ðŸ”¹ Uses **Seaborn bar plots** to visualize approval rates across different age and employment groups.  
  ðŸ”¹ Ensures fair and unbiased predictions in the credit approval process.
